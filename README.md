## Features

### Tasks / Notes

#### Task list

With the list (now called check-list in the application) you can create, delete, sort, filter and search for tasks, both current and completed ones, as well as those moved to the trash.

#### Priority level

Create notes that can also be a task list, have the ability to set a priority level.

#### Server-side saving

Tasks are saved in the cloud, so you can access them from anywhere in the world!

#### Date and time

You also have the option of adding a date to the task, as well as the duration of the selected task.

#### Text-editor

The editor offers the so-called "command-menu", a set of "commands" that create different variants of text styles:

- Plain text
- Simple task list
- Header in three sizes
- Numbered list
- Unnumbered list
- Quote
- Code

Additionally, you can edit each text element manually by selecting it and selecting one of the available options:

- Type (same as "command-menu")
- Link
- Bold
- Italics
- Underline
- Circle
- Strikethrough
- Change text color
- Code

### Calendar

The ability to set the date is, of course, related to the calendar. The calendar allows you to change the date of a selected task (treated as an event), but also allows you to edit each event in the same way as you edit tasks, because the same editor is available here.

### Settings

#### Themes
